## What are we doing? 
### The problem
* Ecological data from the Far North is not readily available to resident communities
* Indigenous communities not proprtionaly represented at the open science table 

### The solution 
With Open the North we seek to create a open repository that stores open data from the [Far North][link_farnorth] of Ontario. This virtual storage space will allow anyone to contribute open data collected from the Far North with a user friendly interface. The repository welcomes data from the federal and provincial governments, NGO's, conservation groups and encourages contibutions from citizen scientists. 

This mobile friendly platform not only allows the addition of data but also the ability to download data. 

## Who are we?
Monica is a post-doctoral fellow at the [Univeristy of Guelph][link_Guelph] and the [Wildlife Conservation Society Canada][link_WCSC] and the creator of Open the North.
