# Open-the-North
Making ecological community data more accessible to the indigenous communities from which it was gathered 

## Welcome
Welcome to the Open the North repository. This document (README.md) will details the focus of our project and how you can get involved. 

## What are we doing? 
### The problem
* Ecological data from Far North not available to resident communities
* Indigenous communities not proprtionaly represented at the metaphorical open science table
