# Open-the-North
Making ecological community data more accessible to the indigenous communities of the Far North

## Welcome
Welcome to the Open the North repository. This document (README.md) details the focus of our project and how you can get involved.

## What are we doing? 
### The problem
* Ecological data from the Far North is not readily available to resident communities
* Critical fish consumption data is not availible in a mobile-friendly, low bandwith format
* Indigenous communities not proprtionaly represented at the open science table 

### The solution 
With Open the North we seek to 1. Build a mobile app for the [Guide to the Guide to Eating Ontario Fish][link_Guide] 2. Create a open repository that stores open data from the [Far North][link_farnorth] of Ontario. This virtual storage space will allow anyone to contribute open data collected from the Far North with a user friendly interface. The repository welcomes data from the federal and provincial governments, NGO's, conservation groups and encourages contibutions from citizen scientists. This mobile friendly platform not only allows the addition of data but also the ability to download data. 

## Who are we?
Monica is a post-doctoral fellow at the [Univeristy of Guelph][link_Guelph] and the [Wildlife Conservation Society Canada][link_WCSC] and the creator of Open the North. You can contact Monica at monica.granados AT alumni.utoronto.ca. This project is a part of the Mozilla Open Leadership Training series. 

## What do we need?
You can find information on how to contibute in the [CONTRIBUTING.md][link_contributing] but generally for the two themes of the project:
### The Guide mobile app
1. App developers to take the open data from the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change and build a low bandwidth mobile app
2. Designers to create the mobile app interface 
3. Translators to translate the Guide text from English to Cree and Ojibway

### The Repository 
1. Upload open data from the Far North 
2. Identify open data that we can extract and add to the repository
