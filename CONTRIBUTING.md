#Contributing to Open the North 

Thank you for your interest in the project. We believe that these projects can have real on-the-ground impacts to the thousands of people that call Ontario's Far North Home. This page is in progress, but for now you can either contact me at monica.granados AT alumni.utoronto.ca or open a new issue.
