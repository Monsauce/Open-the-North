# Contributing to Open the North 

Thank you for your interest in the project. We believe that these projects can have real on-the-ground impacts to the thousands of people that call Ontario's Far North home. 

##The Guide
Our first priority is to develop a mobile application of the [Guide to the Guide to Eating Ontario Fish][link_Guide]. Currently the data is availible only in a printed book format in a series of tables or a web map interface. The goal is to take the CSV file in this reposistory and build a mobile web app that can display the number of fish that are safe to consume.
